    <p>
        Years prior, you made the decision to slam on the breaks for a crossing squirrel. <br>
        The car screeches to a halt, and the frightened squirrel escapes within a second of his life. <br>
        You continue onwards. <br>
        Unbeknowst to you, the squirrel pledges to you a life debt. <br>
        He vows to come to your aid in your time of need. <br>
        The years pass. <br>
        Times grow dark. <br>
        Soon, the entire continent is set ablaze. <br>
        Bombs drop from the sky night after night. <br>
        The situation is dire. <br>
        Every man is needed for the defense of King and Country. <br>
        The RAF knocks upon your door. <br>
        You too, will defend your home. <br>
        They shall not pass. <br>
        Bullets tear through the clouds, turning them into shreds. <br>
        You navigate your plane through the war-torn skies. <br>
        But you are outnumbered. <br>
        The enemy begins to creep forward, pressing their advantage. <br>
        You watch as all your brothers begin to fall. <br>
        Bullets riddle your plane. <br>
        You hold out with your last ounce of strength. <br>
        Then, in your darkest hour, the squirrel arrives. <br>
        Sunbeams radiate off his wings. <br>
        You watch as he dives headfirst into the action, buying you time. <br>
        You drag your limping plane to the nearest airfield. <br>
        You decide to look back. <br>
        For a glorious moment, he is tearing through the enemy, bringing down plane after plane. <br>
        He seems invincible. <br>
        But numbers soon start to take their toll. <br>
        Wave after wave of enemy fighters surge forwards like the endless tides of the Atlantic.<br>
        He is overwhelmed. <br>
        You watch as his plane bursts into flames. <br>
        His life debt has finally been paid. <br>
        You land on the airfield. <br>
        Men and women start stream out of the barracks. <br>
        "You're a hero!" They say <br>
        "No," You reply. <br>
        "I was saved by one." <br>
        Rest in Spaghetti Never Forgetti <br>
